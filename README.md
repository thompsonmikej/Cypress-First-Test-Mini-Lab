# Cypress-First-Test-Mini-Lab

**Developed at devCodeCamp**

A learning exercise focused on writing an initial Cypress test script. This project demonstrates the basics of scripting white-box tests using Cypress on a ReactJS app, covering real-time UI interactions and assertions.

---

## Features

- Hands-on experience scripting end-to-end tests  
- White-box testing for React components and user flows  
- Use of Cypress for simulating and verifying UI behavior  
- Demonstrates basics of automated test execution [[1](https://www.browserstack.com/guide/how-to-test-react-using-cypress)][2][3]

---

## Technologies Used

- ReactJS
- Cypress.io

---

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Cypress-First-Test-Mini-Lab.git
    cd Cypress-First-Test-Mini-Lab
    ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```
    npm install
    ```

3. **Run Cypress:**
    ```
    npx cypress open
    ```
   - Choose your test file from the Cypress test runner and start testing your React application UI [[1](https://www.browserstack.com/guide/how-to-test-react-using-cypress)][2][3].

---

## Usage

- Modify and run example Cypress test scripts under `cypress/e2e/`.
- Use Cypress commands (e.g., `cy.visit()`, `cy.get()`, `.type()`, `.should()`) to simulate user interactions and assert UI states [[1](https://www.browserstack.com/guide/how-to-test-react-using-cypress)][2][5].
- View results live in the Cypress window or console.

---

## Challenges & Lessons Learned

- Learned how to script and execute automated UI tests for React apps using Cypress[[1](https://www.browserstack.com/guide/how-to-test-react-using-cypress)][3].
- Understood best practices in white-box and end-to-end testing.
- Experienced immediate feedback from the Cypress test runner, making it easier to debug and refine tests.

---

## Future Improvements

- Expand coverage to more complex React components and user workflows.
- Integrate Cypress tests with CI pipelines for automated quality assurance.
- Explore component testing and advanced assertions for robust validation [[3](https://docs.cypress.io/app/component-testing/react/overview)].
